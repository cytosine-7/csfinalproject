# Health Management Website – Week 17 Project

This project is a semester-long group project developed for Week 17: Implementation and GitHub Deployment.

## Project Overview
This is a health management website designed to help users better understand and manage their daily health habits. The system allows users to input personal data and record daily activities related to physical well-being.

## Features
- **BMI Calculation**  
  Users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI.

- **Daily Water Intake Planning**  
  The system helps users estimate how much water they should drink per day.

- **Calorie Intake Planning**  
  Users can plan and track daily calorie intake.

- **Exercise Record**  
  Users can record daily exercise activities.

- **Sleep Quality Record**  
  Users can track their sleep quality as part of overall health management.

## Future Improvements
In addition to physical health, this project also aims to pay more attention to **mental health**. Planned improvements include:
- A mood tracking feature that allows users to record their daily emotions.
- Providing supportive or encouraging messages based on the user's mood (e.g., positive messages when feeling down).

These features are intended to make the system more holistic by addressing both physical and psychological well-being.

## Deployment
This project is deployed using GitHub Pages.  
The source code is available in this repository.

## Note
This repository is an individual fork of a group project, maintained separately to meet the course requirements.
